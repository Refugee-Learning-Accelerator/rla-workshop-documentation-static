## Problem

The Syrian and Jordanian math curricula are different, and because of this difference many Syrian refugee students are missing key math concepts from the grade 5 portion of the Jordanian curriculum. Without these concepts, they have many problems in math class.

## Solution

Interactive offline and online platform that will tackle the basic mathematical concepts through engaging videos, simulation and interactive activities while delivering an individualized learning roadmap.

The platform will provide incentives for students like rewards and the possibility of free IGCSE preparation for students in grades 6 to 9.
