## Problem

Refugee students, especially those from 6 to 12 years of age, both in camps and in the city, need a lot of support with their homework and studying for exams. Unfortunately, their parents can't help them as most of them are not educated or donâ€™t have time.

At the same time, teachers from this community who are refugees from Syria, can't work as teachers in public schools, and hence aren't currently paid to work as teachers, but must instead find jobs unrelated to their training.

## Solution

Our solution is to connect these students and these teachers. We provide the students with online teachers from their community, via a mobile app. The teachers will help them with their homework and studying, and the teacher will get paid according to the time that they spend, online, with the student.
