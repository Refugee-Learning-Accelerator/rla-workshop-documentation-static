We are a well-rounded Lebanese team with complimentary abilities from UX/UI, backend programming, machine learning, to hardware engineering. 

We aim to provide overworked teachers with active feedback on the classroomâ€™s understanding & educational mood, and facilitating peer-to-peer learning via a hardware solution. We are targeting high school students as our pilot target group, planning to roll-out to different age groups in a later stage.

## Our By Statement
>Helping overworked teachers in large classrooms by providing them with instantaneous feedback and facilitating peer 2 peer learning via a cheap hardware solution. 

## Problem
Refugees are receiving their primary education in overcrowded classrooms with 30+ students.  These students also taught in a second shift. As a result the teacher is coming from a morning shift or another job entirely. In addition, these teachers don't come from the same cultural background as the student. All these conditions, lessen the quality of the education given by the teacher. 
## Solution
We are trying to facilitate peer to peer education in these instances within the classroom by doing the following. 
* Provide instant feedback to the teacher if the student got the concept
* Suggest Groupings of the students to the teacher in order to get the most effective p2p. 
* Minimize the integration of the system to any curriculum. 
* Encourage students to participate and be honest about their capabilities
* Asking capable peers about how to tackle the problem

## Current Model
Each student has a clicker app on their mobile phones/ or a specially dedicated clicker that connects to Bluetooth on the teachers phone.
