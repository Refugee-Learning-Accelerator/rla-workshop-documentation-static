## Problem

Most young refugee children don't learn any English, even though it can be so helpful. Furthermore, these children have cultural identity challenges because they've lived most of their lives outside their home countries. 

## Solution

We introduce an easier way for refugees to learn English by incorporating an interactive platform for books they already enjoy into their reading experience. 

Using augmented reality we introduce multimedia experiences into a book by viewing through a cell phone. The child can practice spelling, pronunciation, reading and vocabulary, all through a fun app. 

Children will be educating their parents indirectly, preserving heritage through the stories, and building their own self-worth and dignity.
