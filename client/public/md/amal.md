## Problem

In Jordan, Syrians with university degrees have no job prospects, due to only being allowed to work in certain sectors, and a high drop out rate because of low trust in the education system. 

Vocational training already exists but it hasn't yet found a pathway for its graduates to get a job. 

## Solution

Partnerships and agreements between NGOs, training centres and the employers. We will talk to employers and find out what technical and personal skills they need from their employees and relay that information to the training centres to tailor a curriculum that will best fit the needs of the market. 

We will provide an online course where in the first two weeks the learner will learn about their legal rights regarding work, high level information about the profession they are interested in (e.g. Carpentry 101) and the typical work environment in that profession. After the firs ttwo weeks, the learner will alternate monthly training at a training centre and the work site. After four months, they are ready to work full-time. 

We will also have a website where Syrian youth can go and learn more about education training and the professions best matched to their strengths. 

Finally, the website also provides a matching service for Jordanians to find skilled refugee business partners.
