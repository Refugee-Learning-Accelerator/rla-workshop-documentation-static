## Problem

In Lebanon, some of the most vulnerable and hard to reach communities have been without proper educational opportunities for years now. When they are being reached with quality non-formal education by Community Based Organizations, tracking progress as students are often forced to move regularly has been impossible, leading to disillusionment and permanent drop out. Also, tech based solutions are either not reaching the hard to reach areas or fail to provide the appropriate resources and methodology.

## Solution

We build a device that NGOs can customize with educational material, being it officially curriculum aligned content, custom designed content for training purposes or world class free resources like Khan Academy. Our device is a turnkey solution -- it is easy and fast to deploy, making it suitable even for harsh disaster scenarios. Even though it is offline, it will be able to sync user profiles of learners and teachers to the cloud so that users are not stuck to one learning center in one particular location.
