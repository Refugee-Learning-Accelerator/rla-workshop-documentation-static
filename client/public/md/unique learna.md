## Problem

Refugee students have problems accessing learning programs. One of the biggest barriers is language -- university programs are in English in Jordan.  For online education programs, in addition to language, getting a quality internet connection can be a challenge.

## Solution

We aim to provide an interactive offline Arabic language program that downloads interactive tutorials that explain how to use basic and important applications for Refugee, like Microsoft Excel or Adobe Photoshop. The interactive features follow you and help you throughout the process of learning an application, (TIP) Tutorials for interactive programs.
