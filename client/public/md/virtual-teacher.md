## Problem

Refugee kids from Syria come to Kurdistan and don't know the local language and they suffer because they can't integrate into the local community. 

## Solution

We help students learn the basics of the Kurdish language by providing a Virtual Reality (VR) application that combines education and entertainment. The application takes the user into real life scenarios where they can interact with many objects and hopefully learn Kurdish. The application is available via an after school program at a learning centre.
