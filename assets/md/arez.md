## Problem

Most of the refugees have some background in English but can't use it in a day-to-day context. For example, a job interview requires a CV, answering questions in English and dressing in a particular way: most refugees have trouble with these requirements. 

## Solution

We won't teach English as a whole language but focus on specific scenarios that are most helpful to refugees. 

We are building a mobile application that teaches English in specific scenarios by engaging the learner through location-based notifications and using artificial intelligence to identify scenarios around the learner. 

Our main focus is to teach through practice rather than typing. Learners will need to speak their answers.
