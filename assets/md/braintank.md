## Problem
Among refugees, there is a:

* Lack of awareness of learning disabilities 
* Lack of access to learning disability centres
* Cultural stigma around discussing learning disabilities and your child

Also, there is a competitive "NGO Market" -- NGOs competing for clients, and not neccessarily connecting the best NGO for a given child's problem.

## Solution
We create a middle man, a chat bot, between parents and/or teachers, and NGOs that work with kids with learning disabilities. Via questions, the chat bot determines the best NGOs to send a case to, and connects clients with those NGOs.
